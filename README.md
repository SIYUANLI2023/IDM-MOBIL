# A Reproducible Rule-Based Baseline for Multi-Lane Highway Interaction: Integrating IDM, MOBIL, and Hysteretic Following

The rule-based baseline provides a reproducible and interpretable reference for highway driving, designed to benchmark prediction-aware decision-making frameworks in Simulation Case~2. It integrates the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) for longitudinal control, the MOBIL criterion for lane-change decisions, and a quintic time-scaling profile for lateral motion generation. To mitigate oscillatory braking behavior often induced by Time-to-Collision (TTC) triggers, a hysteretic car-following mechanism is incorporated for the primary interacting vehicle (SV1). Specifically, SV1 performs an event-triggered acceleration when the ego vehicle (EV) initiates a lane change, and subsequently switches to a latching proportional–derivative (PD) following law that regulates inter-vehicle spacing and relative velocity. The framework attributes vehicles undergoing lane changes to their target lanes for consistent safety evaluation and employs asynchronous longitudinal and lateral update cycles to emulate realistic driver behavior. Overall, this baseline serves as a transparent benchmark for assessing the performance differences between conventional rule-based approaches and the proposed HMDP–MPC decision-making framework.
